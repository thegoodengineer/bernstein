"""Sign and verify ``AgentIdentityCard`` instances for A2A v1.0 federation.

The current ``AgentIdentityCard.card_hash`` is a SHA-256 over the JSON body -
useful as an internal HMAC anchor but not a *signature*. Third-party A2A
verifiers won't accept a hash, so any Bernstein agent that wants to federate
with another A2A-speaking system has to fall back to bespoke trust.

This module wraps the existing card body in a detached **JSON Web Signature**
(RFC 7515 compact form) over the JCS-canonicalized (RFC 8785) bytes, signed
with **Ed25519** (RFC 8037 / EdDSA). The card body is left untouched, so the
existing ``card_hash`` stays stable through the transition - verifiers that
understand A2A v1.0 read the JWS, while internal code keeps using the body.

Tracks `kcolbchain/switchboard#25`-style A2A spec work and bernstein
`#1095`. Future work (deferred to a follow-up PR):

- ``/.well-known/agent.json`` HTTP route.
- JWKS endpoint at ``/.well-known/agent.json/keys``.
- Adding A2A v1.0 fields (``protocol_version``, ``supported_interfaces``,
  ``security_schemes``, ``signatures``) to ``AgentIdentityCard`` itself.
- RFC 8707 Resource Indicators in ``auth_middleware``.

The Ed25519 primitives reuse the same ``cryptography`` package already used
by ``sigstore_attestation`` and the HIPAA AES-GCM helpers.
