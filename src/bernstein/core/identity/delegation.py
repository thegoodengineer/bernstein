"""Per-hop HMAC-chained delegation receipts (RFC 8693-style token exchange).

A single run authorizes a chain of principals:
``principal -> orchestrator -> sub-agent``. Each hop is an act of delegation
(the principal authorizes the orchestrator; the orchestrator spawns a
sub-agent to act on the principal's behalf). This module records one
*delegation receipt* per hop, HMAC-chained so an auditor can reconstruct
offline exactly which principal authorized which sub-agent action for a run.

Receipt shape
-------------
Each receipt is one JSONL line under ``<root>/delegation/<run_id>.jsonl``::

    {
      "run_id": "...",
      "hop_index": 0,
      "issuer": "principal:alex",     # who is delegating (RFC 8693 subject)
      "subject": "orchestrator",      # the acting party being authorized
      "audience": "sub-agent:backend",# the target the token is minted for
      "act": "task.spawn",            # the delegated action
      "created": 1730000000,
      "prev_hmac": "<hex>",
      "hmac": "<hex>",

      # optional authority binding (absent on receipts written before it
      # existed); see bernstein.core.identity.delegation_scope
      "parent_ref": "<hmac of the hop this descends from>",
      "scope_ref": "sha256:<hex>",    # content address of the granted scope
      "scope": {...},                 # the effective scope, carried inline
      "binding": {"charter_hash": "...", "certificate_version": "..."}
    }

The HMAC covers the previous receipt's HMAC concatenated with the canonical
JSON of this receipt's body (all fields except ``hmac``), using the same
construction as :mod:`bernstein.core.security.audit`. A flipped field, a
deleted hop, or the wrong key surfaces as a linkage/HMAC error in
:func:`verify_run_chain` rather than passing silently.

The key is the install-scoped audit key (``load_or_create_audit_key``) so the
delegation chain shares the install's tamper-evidence anchor: strip the
identity and the chain no longer verifies.

Sequence is not narrowing
-------------------------
The HMAC chain proves the *order and integrity* of a delegation sequence. It
cannot prove that authority narrowed, because until the ``scope`` fields above
existed the authority granted at each hop was never written down - so the only
answer to "did this sub-agent hold more than the worker that spawned it?" was
"the route checks would have refused it", which is an argument rather than a
receipt. A hop that records its effective scope and names its parent lets
:func:`verify_run_chain` recompute the child-subset-of-parent relation from the
receipts alone. The recomputation, the separation-of-duties check, and the
decision-time charter binding live in
:mod:`bernstein.core.identity.delegation_scope`.
