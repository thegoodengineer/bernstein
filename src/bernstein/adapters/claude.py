"""Claude Code CLI adapter.

The heavy-lifting helpers for MCP config merging, cache-control block
construction, and the inline wrapper-script source live in three sibling
modules extracted by
* :mod:`bernstein.adapters.claude_mcp_loader` - ``load_mcp_config`` / ``_resolve_env_vars``
* :mod:`bernstein.adapters.claude_cache_control` - ``build_cacheable_system_blocks``
* :mod:`bernstein.adapters.claude_wrapper_script` - ``build_wrapper_script``

They are re-exported from this module so existing callers (and tests
that patch symbols via ``bernstein.adapters.claude.<name>``) continue to
work without changes.

# sent" and later replays it can diverge if compaction changed between the two:
# the replay reconstructs the sent context, but a compaction event altered what
# the recorded run actually consumed.
#
# The load-bearing, verifiable guarantee here is NOT that we can force
# compaction off. It is that the compaction policy state is captured in the
# step fingerprint (the HMAC/Merkle step journal). If compaction behaviour
# changes between record and replay, the fingerprint diverges and the mismatch
# is DETECTED and attributable to a named field rather than surfacing as a
# mysterious, unexplained rewrite. That detection is the deterministic-replay
# lever; it holds regardless of whether any suppression request is honoured.
#
# As a best-effort layer, in deterministic-record or hermetic-replay mode we
# additionally REQUEST that the CLI suppress its client-side auto-compaction.
# This is a best-effort request, not an authoritative guarantee: it targets the
# CLI's own auto-compaction behaviour and cannot promise anything about any
# server-side context handling. The fingerprint is what makes a divergence
# safe; the suppression request only reduces how often one happens.

# The env flags below are the source of truth for the run mode. They mirror
# the ones read by the orchestrator (BERNSTEIN_DETERMINISTIC_SEED for record,
