"""Bughunt for the A2A v1.0 signed agent card surface.

Each test pins a specific JWS / JCS failure mode in the verifier
surface. Findings:

#1 (FIXED):
    ``verify_agent_card`` raised ``AttributeError`` when a JWS protected
    header decoded to a non-object JSON value (``[]``, ``null``, ``42``,
    ``"str"``). Network-controlled input → 500 / unhandled exception. Now
    returns ``False`` defensively (``isinstance(header, dict)`` guard).

#2 (FIXED - RFC 8785 §3.2.2.3 number serialisation):
    JCS-canonicalised numbers used to differ from the spec for
    integer-valued floats (``10.0`` → ``"10.0"``, should be ``"10"``), for
    scientific notation on either side of the ES6 thresholds (``1e-7`` →
    ``"1e-07"``, should be ``"1e-7"``), and for negative zero. Cards carry
    ``max_budget_usd``, ``created_at`` and ``expires_at`` as floats, so a
    strictly RFC-8785-compliant verifier computed different bytes than the
    signer whenever one of those landed on an integer boundary.
    ``canonicalize_jcs`` now implements the ECMAScript ``Number::toString``
    rule the spec cites, and the official reference vector
    ``structures.json`` passes (``56.0`` → ``56``).

#3 (FIXED in #3105 - RFC 8785 §3.2.3 key-sort order):
    Object keys used to be sorted by Unicode code point (Python
    ``sort_keys``) rather than by UTF-16 code units. For BMP-only keys the
    two agree; once a key crosses U+FFFF (surrogate pair) the bytes diverged
    from spec, because ``😂`` (U+1F602, UTF-16 high surrogate 0xD83D) sorts
    before ``שּ`` (U+FB33) under UTF-16 and after it under code-point order.
    ``canonicalize_jcs`` now sorts property names by UTF-16 code units, so
    ``test_rfc_8785_utf16_keysort`` below is a positive assertion.

#4 (operational, xfail - verifier accepts expired cards):
    ``verify_agent_card`` does not consult ``card.is_expired()`` -
    integrators must remember to call it themselves. Replay-by-stale-card
    is not addressed at the cryptographic verifier layer.

#5 (operational, documented - ephemeral per-process keypair):
    Each orchestrator process mints a fresh keypair on first JWKS hit. A
    federated verifier polling JWKS from a different replica than the one
    that signed will fail verification. Tracked in well_known.py docstring
    - persistence is deferred.

#6 (PARTIAL - JWKS rotation grace window publishes, but does not route):
    The orchestrator used to publish exactly one key, so a rotation broke
    every in-flight verifier holding the previous one. ``agent_json_keys``
    now appends every archived public key still inside the keystore's
    grace window (24h by default), so a verifier that tries every key in
    the JWKS is rescued.

    A verifier that routes by ``kid`` is not, and ``well_known.py`` claims
    it is. A card is signed under the *stable* kid
    (``agent-bernstein-orchestrator``, ``_tenant_kid``) while an archived
    key is published under a *timestamped* one
    (``agent-bernstein-orchestrator-<stamp>``, ``ArchivedKey.kid``). After
    a rotation the stable kid resolves to the **new** key, and the old key
    sits under a kid no card ever referenced::

        signing kid on a card : agent-bernstein-orchestrator
        jwks kid=agent-bernstein-orchestrator            -> new key
        jwks kid=agent-bernstein-orchestrator-2026...Z   -> retired key

    ``identity/http_signing.py`` gets this right by keying archived JWKs on
    the thumbprint the signature carries. Pinned as an xfail below.

#7 (FIXED - private signing key file mode):
    Persistence landed as :class:`AgentCardKeystore`, and it enforces
    ``0600`` in three places: the private PEM is created with ``O_EXCL``
    and mode ``0600``, chmodded again after write, and a key already on
    disk with looser permissions is *refused* rather than loaded. The
    placeholder here asserted a path the implementation never used
    (``.sdd/security/keys/agent_signing/``, against a keystore rooted at
    ``.bernstein/keys``), so it reported the control missing on a tree
    that had it.

#8 (PARTIAL - RFC 8707 resource indicators: implemented, opt-in, claim-conditional):
    ``auth_middleware`` consults the JWT ``resource`` claim through
    ``_resource_indicator_check`` and answers a mismatch with the RFC 6750
    challenge ``Bearer error="invalid_token",
    error_description="resource indicator mismatch"``. That machinery is
    real and covered in
    ``tests/unit/test_auth_middleware_resource_indicator.py``.

    Two gaps keep the original finding open on a default install, and
    neither is a bug in that machinery:

    1. **Opt-in.** ``expected_resource`` defaults to ``""``
       (``auth.py``), so with the environment variable unset the tuple is
       empty, ``_resource_indicator_check`` returns early, and a token
       minted for another resource server is accepted out of the box.
    2. **Claim-conditional.** Even where enforcement *is* configured, a
       token carrying no ``resource`` claim at all passes.

    So a stolen Bearer can still be replayed at a sibling resource server
    on a stock deployment. Closing that is a separate change with its own
    risk (OIDC puts the client id in ``aud``, so treating ``aud`` as a
    resource indicator would break ordinary setups); what is recorded here
    is what shipped.

#9 (FIXED - ``typ`` cross-context replay):
    Confirmed via :class:`TestTypReplayContext`. The verifier rejects any
    JWS whose protected header carries a different ``typ`` value, even if
    signed by the same Ed25519 key.

#10 (operational, xfail - rotation archive is not bounded): rotation has
    landed, and every rotation moves the previous keypair under
    ``archive/<isoformat>/``. ``list_archived`` filters that directory by
    the grace window when publishing the JWKS, but nothing removes an entry
    once it falls outside: its docstring says old archives "may be GC'd by
    the operator out-of-band". Repeated rotation therefore grows a
    directory of retired *private* keys without bound.

The ``typ: agent-card+jws`` cross-context replay invariant is verified
positively in :class:`TestTypReplayContext`.

RFC 8785 reference vector status (cyberphone/json-canonicalization):
    arrays.json    PASS
    french.json    PASS
    values.json    PASS
    structures.json PASS (since #2 was fixed)
    weird.json     PASS

``weird.json`` was recorded here as FAIL on U+007F escaping. It was not.
Its literals had been transcribed by hand and lost three characters on the
way, so the test drove a payload the vector does not contain against bytes
no conformant implementation produces, and the xfail pinned that rather
than a divergence. RFC 8785 section 3.2.2.2 defers string serialization to
ECMAScript's ``JSON.stringify``, which escapes the quote, the backslash
and U+0000 to U+001F and emits everything else as-is, U+007F included.
All five published vectors were checked against
``cyberphone/json-canonicalization/testdata/`` and ``canonicalize_jcs``
reproduces each one byte for byte.
